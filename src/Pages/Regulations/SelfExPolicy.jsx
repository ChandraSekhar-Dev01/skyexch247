            If you feel you are at risk of developing a gambling problem or believe you
            currently have a gambling problem, please consider using Self-Exclusion
            which prevents you gambling with Skyexch.art for a specified period of 6
            months, 1 year, 2 years, 5 years or permanently.

          <p className="mb-3">
            During a period of Self-Exclusion you will not be able to use your account
            for betting, although you will still be able to login and withdraw any
            remaining balance. It will not be possible to re-open your account for any
            reason, and Skyexch.art will do all it can to detect and close any new
            accounts you may open.
          </p>
