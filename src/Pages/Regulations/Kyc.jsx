        <p className='mb-[12px]'>
          To maintain the highest level of security, we require all our members to
          provide us with certain documentation in order to validate their accounts.
        </p>
        <p className='mb-[12px]'>
          Please note that the identification procedures shall be done before a
          cardholder starts operating and using services of our merchants.
        </p>
        <h3 className='mt-[16px] mb-[8px] text-[18px] text-[#1e1e1ee6] font-bold'>Why do I need to provide documentation?</h3>
        <p className='mb-[12px]'>There are several reasons:</p>
        <p className='mb-[12px]'>
          We are committed to providing a socially responsible platform for online
          gaming. All of our members must be 18 or older and we are bound by our
          licensing agreement to verify this.
        </p>
        <p className='mb-[12px]'>
          Secondly, as a respected online and global company it is in our interests to
          guarantee maximum security on all transactions.
        </p>
        <p className='mb-[12px]'>
          Thirdly, our payment processors require that our policies are in line with
          international banking standards. A proven business relationship with each
          and every member is mandatory for the protection of all parties. Our
          licensing agreement also obliges us to comply with this.
        </p>
        <p className='mb-[12px]'>
          Finally, by ensuring that your account details are absolutely correct, the
          inconvenience of 'missing payments' can be avoided. It can take weeks (and
          sometimes months) to trace, recall and resend using the correct information.
          This lengthy process also results in additional fees from our processors.
        </p>
        <h3 className='mt-[16px] mb-[8px] text-[18px] text-[#1e1e1ee6] font-bold'>WHAT DOCUMENTS DO I NEED TO PROVIDE?</h3>
        <p className='mb-[12px]'>PROOF OF ID:</p>
        <p className='mb-[12px]'>
          A color copy of a valid government issued form of ID (Driver's License,
          Passport, State ID or Military ID)
        </p>
        <h3 className='mt-[16px] mb-[8px] text-[18px] text-[#1e1e1ee6] font-bold'>PROOF OF ADDRESS:</h3>
        <p className='mb-[12px]'>A copy of a recent utility bill showing your address</p>
        <p className='mb-[12px]'>
          Note: If your government Id shows your address, you do not need to provide
          further proof of address.
        </p>
        <p className='mb-[12px]'>
          Additional documentation might be required depending on the withdrawal
          method you choose
        </p>
        <h3 className='mt-[16px] mb-[8px] text-[18px] text-[#1e1e1ee6] font-bold'>When do I need to provide these documents?</h3>
        <p className='mb-[12px]'>
          We greatly appreciate your cooperation in providing these at your earliest
          possible convenience to avoid any delays in processing your transactions. We
          must be in receipt of the documents before any cash transactions can be sent
          back to you. Under special circumstances we may require the documents before
          further activity (deposits and wagering) can take place on your account
        </p>
        <p className='mb-[12px]'>
          Please understand, if we do not have the required documents on file, your
          pending withdrawals will be cancelled and credited back to your account. You
          will be notified when this happens via the notification system.
        </p>
        <h3 className='mt-[16px] mb-[8px] text-[18px] text-[#1e1e1ee6] font-bold'>How can I send you these documents?</h3>
        <p className='mb-[12px]'>
          Please scan your documents, or take a high quality digital camera picture,
          save the images as jpegs, then upload the files using our secure form.
        </p>
        <h3 className='mt-[16px] mb-[8px] text-[18px] text-[#1e1e1ee6] font-bold'>How do I know my documents are safe with you?</h3>
        <p className='mb-[12px]'>
          The security of your documentation is of paramount importance. All files are
          protected with the highest level of encryption at every step of the review
          process. All documentation received is treated with the utmost respect and
          confidentiality.
